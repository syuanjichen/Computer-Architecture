# Computer-Architecture
The homework in Computer Architecture by Prof. An-Yeu Wu, Spring 2025

## Homework 01
- Set up gem5 simulation environment
- Use RISC-V assembly languange to implement recursion and a dynamic programming algorithm
- Use RIPES to visualize and simulate the execution of CPU

## Homework 02
- Implement Homework 01 code using different processors (with forwarding, without forwarding or without hazard detection) in RIPES.
- Optimize simulation time of Homework 01 code.
- Compare the performance of assembly code and C++ code of the same program.

## Homework 03
- Implement an L2 cache in the predefined environment and run the merge sort algorithm.
- Analyze the performance under different L1 data cache size, L1 instruction cache and L2 cache size and associativity.
- Find an optimal setting to minimize running time.
